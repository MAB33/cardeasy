Wouldn't it be great if you could set up an entire year's worth of birthday cards at once, and have them mailed out for you, automatically, right on time for your friends' and family members' birthdays?

Of course! And that's where Simply Sent comes in. It's simple, it's quick, and of course, it's easy.

Once signed up, simply pick a card, personalize a message, choose to send it to one, or many, of your saved contacts and we handle the rest. We'll make sure that when a recipientâ€™s birthday is coming up, their card is mailed out to reach them by their birthday.
